              Hello! My name is <strong>Kalpit agarwal</strong>. I am originally
              from Udaipur, Rajasthan, but I am currently pursuing my bachelor's
              degree at LNMIIT, Jaipur. During my time here, I have gained
              valuable experience through various workshops and interactions
              with different personalities. These experiences have greatly
              enhanced my work ethic, communication skills, and adaptability.

              Exploring and working on diverse projects has been an incredibly
              rewarding and unique experience for me. I am eager to continue
              delving into exciting future projects, particularly in the fields
              of web development and cross-platform mobile development.
              Additionally, I am currently striving to understand the world of
              AI and machine learning, which further enhances my enthusiasm for
              technology. These areas captivate me, and I am committed to
              continually enhancing my skills and knowledge to stay at the
              forefront of innovation.

              I am currently working on the development of the Super Coach and
              BBI API within the MERN stack team. I have successfully converted
              the entire codebase from the designer team into JSX and React
              components. Additionally, I created APIs for coach and athlete
              logins and utilized React Hook Form to develop a dynamic form for
              the Super Coach project.
